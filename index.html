            <p>I will give a talk on the advanced technique about temperature dection using nanoparticle. Here is the main text of my talk.<p>
            <p>Nanothermometers (NTM) could provide temperature information at microscopic level for interpreting the biological process and guiding the disease treatment. Lanthanide ions which contain complex 4f orbit electrons could be used to synthesize nanoparticles with tunable photoluminescence from ultraviolet to near infrared region. What’s more, lanthanide doped nanoparticles could be established as nanothermometer based on the relationship between its luminescence signal (intensity, wavelength and lifetime) and temperature.<p>
            <p>Some outstanding works on nanothermometer have been reported in recent years. Scientists from China have used nanothermometer to guide photothermal therapy to improve the effiency of cancer treatment. And scientists from Austrilia have successfully detected the temperature of mitochondria within cell using NTM. <p>
            <p>However, temperature detection was not equal to temperature imaging. Temperature imaging provides information on temperature distribution in 2D/3D pace. Temperature imaging especialy imaging of micron-sized patterns in vivo using luminescent NTM is still challenging, which is caused by the severe scattering effect of bio-tissue. Herein, we proposed a strategy to build NTM based on lanthanide luminescence with a working wavelength beyond 1500 nm for higher temperature imaging resolution in vivo. The energy transfer between lanthanide ions (Er3+ and Yb3+) and H2O molecules, named as the environment quenching assisted downshifting (EQAD) process, is employed to build temperature-sensitive emissions at 1550 nm and 980 nm. With an optimized thin active shell, 1550 nm emission intensity and thermal sensitivity of NTM are improved by modulating EQAD process. Minimally invasive temperature imaging of mouse cerebrovascular system is demonstrated for the first time by the NTM and the thermometric imaging resolution can reach nearly 200 μm. This work points to a method for high-resolution temperature imaging of micron-level structure in vivo, which will give insight into research in temperature sensory, disease diagnosis and treatment development. <p>
